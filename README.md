# Computer Pointer Controller

Computer-Human Interface Peripheral Signal Manipulation via AI Retina Tracking (CHIPSMART)

## Project Set Up and Installation
Requires:
- One or both of the following hardware:
  - Intel® CPU
  - Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2
- All of the following software:
  - [Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS (Bionic Beaver)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/18.04/)
  - [Python 3.7.6](https://docs.python.org/release/3.7.6/)

## Benchmarks
The Intel® hardware I benchmarked with:
- [Intel® Neural Compute Stick 2](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/140109/intel-neural-compute-stick-2.html)
- [Intel® Core™ i3-3110M Processor (Dual-Core, 3M Cache, 2.40 GHz)](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/65700/intel-core-i3-3110m-processor-3m-cache-2-40-ghz.html)

## Results
*TODO*

## Stand-Out Stuff
*TODO*

### Async Inference
If you have used Async Inference in your code, benchmark the results and explain its effects on power and performance of your project.

### Edge Cases
There will be certain situations that will break your inference flow. For instance, lighting changes or multiple people in the frame. Explain some of the edge cases you encountered in your project and how you solved them to make your project more robust.
