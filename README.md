# Computer Pointer Controller

Computer-Human Interface Peripheral Signal Manipulation via AI Retina Tracking (CHIPSMART)

## Project Set Up and Installation
Requires:
- Ubuntu Linux Version 18.04
- Python 3.7.6
- OpenVINO Version 2020.3.194
- This repository, cloned to a local directory

## Demo
To run this project, simply execute the script titled `run.sh` in the root directory of this repository:
`> ./run.sh`

## Documentation
This readme file

## Benchmarks
I only have an Intel Core i3 CPU

## Results
*TODO:* Discuss the benchmark results and explain why you are getting the results you are getting. For instance, explain why there is difference in inference time for FP32, FP16 and INT8 models.

## Stand Out Suggestions
This is where you can provide information about the stand out suggestions that you have attempted.

### Async Inference
If you have used Async Inference in your code, benchmark the results and explain its effects on power and performance of your project.

### Edge Cases
There will be certain situations that will break your inference flow. For instance, lighting changes or multiple people in the frame. Explain some of the edge cases you encountered in your project and how you solved them to make your project more robust.
